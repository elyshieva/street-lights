<h1>Contact</h1>
Contact consists of two words from early 17th century: 
<ul>
    <li>from Latin contactus, from contact- ‘touched, grasped, bordered on’</li>
    <ul>
      <li>contactus from the verb contingere, from con- ‘together with’ + tangere ‘to touch.</li>  
    </ul>
    
</ul>  
Fascinating, isn't it?
